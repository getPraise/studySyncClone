StudySync Front-End Clone (Responsive Design)
HTML & CSS Project

Developed a responsive front-end clone of the StudySync website using only HTML and CSS. Focused on replicating the visual layout and design elements of the original homepage. The project includes a responsive navigation bar, hero section, and styled content blocks that adapt smoothly to different screen sizes without relying on JavaScript. This clone demonstrates my skills in clean semantic HTML structure, modern CSS styling, and responsive web design techniques.
